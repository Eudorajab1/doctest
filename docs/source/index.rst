WebSaw user guide
==================

**WebSaw** is an acronym for **Web** **Software** **Application** **Warehouse** and is essentially
a superfast, lightweight web application framework offering developers a fast, secure and flexible development platform 
from inital protyping through deployment.

Whether you are a Vue / Python /JS or HTML/CSS delveloper **Websaw** provides the tools to seriously improve 
productivity and functionality that other frameworks simply cannot.

So if you are sick and tired of copy/pasting multiple templates/fucntions/classes across multiple applications
or indeed even among modules in the same application then you have definately landed in the right place.

If not then **WebSaw** is probably not for you.

If you need to develop **Single Page Apps** or **Client/Server Apps** or even a combination of the above
securely, quickly and efficently  **READ ON**.

So why WebSaw?
--------------

Development on traditional web frameworks generally requires a lot of code duplication whether or not it is html forms or 
similar fucntoin/actions used in multiple contollers. This is very time conusming and prone to errors particularly when upgrding or
adding features to an application.

In addition maintenance becomes laborious with potentially multiple files needing to be changed in order to reflect a simple UI 
enhancement.

In order to address these shortcomings **Websw** allows devlopers to implement **DRY** coding practices in all areas of app development.

**DRY** or *Dont Repeat Yourself* application development is extremely important when developing larger and more complex applications and **WebSaw** 
gives you all the tools and more to do just that. 

Simply stated, **WebSaw** gives you the ability to develop *flexible, secure, robust applications* **rapidly**.
