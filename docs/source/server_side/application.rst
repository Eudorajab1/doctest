The Application Layer
---------------------

The **Application Layer** or **app** is where the majority or our work will be done. As the name suggests
it is effectively where we build the functionality of our application and normally consists of a corntollers.py or a number
of python modules which will contain all the functions and actions required by our application.

So what is the application layer?
.................................

The **Application** layer is responsible for collecting routes along with mounting and wrapping each action by 
route handler with the correct setup/teardown procedures.

Using the Fixture
.................

Now that we have defined and intialised our **custom auth fixture** lets put it to use in our application by including it in application initialisation
and letting the **app** know about it.

The first thing we need to do is to intialise then mount the application or **app**

This we do as follows:
::
    # apps/xauth/controllers.py
    ...
    app = DefaultApp(ctxd, name=__package__)
    ...

.. note:: 
    We are initialising our app by passing in cxtd (our **design** context) as a positional argument. There are a few other arguments which we will cover in later
    chapters but for now they are not required.

Not forgetting in our __init__.py to mount the app
::
    # apps/xaurh/__init__.py
    
    from .controllers import app

    app.mount()

At this stage we should have a fully functioning application that will use our custom **auth** fixture.

The Application
...............

Lets take a look now at our actual application which contains a number of routes or **actions**.
::
    # apps/xauth/controllers.py
    ...
    @app.route('login')
    def login(ctx: Context):
        q = ctx.request.query
        user, autherr = ctx.auth.login(q.login, q.pw)
        if user:
            redirect(ctx.URL('private'))
        return autherr.as_dict()


    @app.route('logout')
    def logout(ctx: Context):
        user = ctx.auth.user or dict(name="Guest")
        ctx.auth.logout()
        return f"By–µ {user['name']}!"


    @app.route('private')
    @app.use(ctxd.auth_guard)
    def private(ctx: Context):
        return dict(user_in_session=ctx.auth_guard.user)


The important things to note here are:
  
    * We access our **auth** fixture as a property of **ctx** (our *Context*)
    * We dont need a sperate routing table for registering our routes. This is all done automaticlly *under-the-hood*
 
We could equally as well intialis a local **auth** in our action by doing somthing like which we can then use as ``auth.login(...)`` if we so desire. 
::
    ...
    auth = ctx.auth
    ...

.. note::

    A **route** indexes our **action** within the current **context** so calls to our **action** will be routed
    correctly in all cases.

    In order to simplify this and to avoid having to set up a seperate **routing table** we have the 
    **@app.route()** decorator which allows us to define a route for a paticular action.

    The **@app.use()** decorator is telling our action to use a particular fixture.


The **Auth** fixture is **NOT** triggered until we actually use it even though it is available at **take_on**. 

You will also notice that in the **private** action we are specifically telling our action to use the **auth_guard** fixture via the 
``@app.use(ctxd.auth_guard)`` decorator. The **auth_guard** fixture is one of the standard **Websaw** convenience fixture and as its name 
implies will prevent any access to any action that is **using** it if so desired.

We will be covering the ``@app.use(...)`` decorator in greater detail throughout later sections of this guide.

Although we did not include it in our **Context** definition is is autmatically available to us as it is part of the **DefaultConext** fixture.
As such we do not need to implicitly include it in our **Context**

Thats it .. we are good to go.

Make sure **Websaw** is running and follow the links below. You will see the appropriate error codes based on how the applicaiton logic.

Try to access the the private action without being logged in and see the result!
