Installation
============

Installing *Websaw* is pretty much a straightforward process as follows:-

* Create a new virtual environment (reccomended for development)
* Activate the venv
* Install websaw using pip

.. important:: 
    Depending on your operating system the installation commands vary slightly.
    example: Windows, you must use backslashes (i.e. ``\``) instead of slashes.
    Please also ensure that you have python >= 3.7 installed along wiht pip and that both are in your os path.


Installation in a production envirnoment is covered later.

So lets get going. The sooner we install Websaw the sooner we can start developing *Awesome* apps!!

.. _quick_start_label:

Quick Start
-----------
   
In order to get started make sure that your os meets the following minimal requirements.

* Pyhton >= 3.7
* pip

For the sake of keeping the instructions generic let us assume that we are woking on a WSL Ubuntu
type development environment.

On Linux OS make sure you have sudo access

For Development purposes we strongly reccomend that you first create a virtual environment in order to
isolate packages and depndancies form your main environment.

To do this you need to open a new bash / shell / cmd window and enter the following:-
::

    python3 -m venv <direcory_name>
    cd <directory_name>
    source ./bin/activate

This above will create a python3 virtual environment and activiate it.

If all is good your prompt will change to the name of the vitual environment you have activated: 
::

    (directory_name)$

This is pythonâ€™s way of telling us that we are now in the virtual environment and we can start installing Websaw.

To deactive the virtual environment simply use the followint command: 
::

    deactivate

This will take you back to your normal python bash prompt

To use Websaw, make sure that your venv is activated and then simply install 
::

    pip install websaw

Once pip has finished installing Websaw and all the required dependancies you should be good to go.

In order to check run the following command 
::

    websaw -h

If you get the following output Websaw has been installed and is ready to use. 
If not please refer to the `Installation`_ section of this manual.
