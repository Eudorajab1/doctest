Component based Templating
==========================

**UPYTL** is an acronym for **Utlimate Python Templating Language** and as the name suggests it allows us to build our templates
in a *pythonic* way and takes much of its inspiration from **Vue.js**. 

In much the same way that **Vue** leverages the use of reusable embedded components for client side processing, **WebSaw**
leverages the use of similar embedded *re-usable* components for client/server applications.

**UPYTL** ships with a fully functional set of standard components designed to get you up an running in no time.

All components are customizable and you can create your own components to suite your individual requirements and taste.
